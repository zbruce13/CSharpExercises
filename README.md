CSharpExercises

Student: Zach Bruce
Course: CSE 210 — Programming with Classes
Date: 2025-10-27

Overview:
This folder contains all my completed programming exercises for Week 01 of CSE 210. Each exercise is built as a separate C# console project and shows the basic language features we covered this week, including input and output, if statements, loops, lists, and functions.

Projects:
- MyFirstApp: Exercise 1 — Variables, Input, and Output
- Exercise2: Exercise 2 — Conditionals (grade calculator)
- Exercise3: Exercise 3 — Loops (Guess My Number game)
- Exercise4: Exercise 4 — Lists and Generics (sum, average, max, sorted list)
- Exercise5: Exercise 5 — Functions (prompting and squaring a number)

How to Run a Project:
1. Clone the repository (or open it if you already have it):
   git clone https://github.com/zbruce13/CSharpExercises.git
2. Move into the exercise folder you want to run, for example:
   cd CSharpExercises/Exercise3
3. Run the program:
   dotnet run

Notes:
The bin and obj folders were removed before uploading to keep things smaller. They will automatically come back when you build or run the program. Each folder has its own Program.cs and .csproj files, so every exercise works as a standalone C# project. I wrote and tested everything in Visual Studio Code.
